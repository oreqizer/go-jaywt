# JWT Parser

An utility package that uses [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) for parsing and verifying JWT tokens from requests.

> While it solves the exact problem [go-jwt-middleware](https://github.com/auth0/go-jwt-middleware), it doesn't have Gorilla context as a dependency and lets you use your own type of claims.
